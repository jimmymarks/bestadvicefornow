# The Best Advice (For Now)

This site will attempt to gather the best advice for the average person to help them navigate the ever-changing landscape with regard to COVID-19.

## What it has

As of now, the site generates posts with condensed, easy-to-read advice. Each post has a space for sources, so that users know exactly who published it. Posts can be tagged to create topics that will expand over time.

## Roadmap

What I'd like to see:

- Illustrations/images to accompany each piece of advice
- More topics and more advice
- More input from knowledgeable experts

I'm actively searching for contributors. If you'd like to join me, send me an email at bestadvicefornow@gmail.com 

### About the guts of the site
