We as a nation have been under a state of emergency since March 13, 2020 ([read the declaration here on the White House website](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/proclamation-declaring-national-emergency-concerning-novel-coronavirus-disease-covid-19-outbreak/)).

With so many new revelations coming in each and every day, it can be difficult to know what to do, day to day.

What follows is a list of the best advice this site (which is independently updated and managed by humans) can offer. For each recommendation offered, we will include links to the sources we used to make that recommendation.

When we update a piece of advice, we will note the date and time that change was made. If you feel a piece of information is misleading or incorrect, reach out to us here.
