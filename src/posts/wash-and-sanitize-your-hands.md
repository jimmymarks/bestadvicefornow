You should **wash your hands regularly**, especially after time spent in a public space or after handling any publicly-accessible utility (shopping carts, door knobs, ATMs, etc.). Use soap and warm water and wash your hands thoroughly for at least 20 seconds. You do not have to have anti-bacterial soap, regular soap is fine.

If you don't have ready access to soap, use a **hand sanitizer with at least 70% alcohol content**. Using both hand sanitizer and a good hand washing regimen can cut your exposure to the virus significantly.
