If you have a cell phone, keys, pen, or other "pocket items" or "everyday carry", you should **clean them with alcohol or a disinfecting wipe at least once per day**. This can help you keep the virus away from your hands and face. Do not use chlorine bleach on your phone, as this will harm the phone.
