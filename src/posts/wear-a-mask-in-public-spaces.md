When you have to visit a store or any publicly-accessible space, you should **wear a face mask that covers your nose and mouth adequately**. You can use a simple bandana, folded over on itself, secured with rubber bands on the side (see the do-it-yourself mask link in "Sources" section). You can also use a cloth mask or a disposable medical mask.

**Wearing masks can prevent the spread of the virus significantly**. Some of the sources consulted in creating this advice post suggest that masks may even be more important than social distancing in slowing the spread of the virus (though the two are recommended to be used together to improve the effect of both). 

Most sources say that it is not necessary to wear a mask _all the time_ or in public, well-ventilated spaces that are not frequently traveled (such as hiking trails or a public street during a walk). Those with respiratory issues may want to wear a mask at these times just in case.
