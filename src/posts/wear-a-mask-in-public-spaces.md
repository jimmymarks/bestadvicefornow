When you have to visit a store or any publicly-accessible space, you should **wear a face mask that covers your nose and mouth adequately**. You can use a simple bandana, folded over on itself, secured with rubber bands on the side (see the do-it-yourself mask link in "Sources" section). You can also use a cloth mask or a disposable medical mask. N95 masks are hard to source at the moment, but do the best job of filtering out harmful particles. 

**Wearing masks can prevent the spread of the virus significantly**. By some estimates, if 60% of the public wore masks day-to-day, we could stop the virus in its tracks. 

Most sources say that it is not necessary to wear a mask all the time or in public, well-ventilated spaces that are not frequently traveled (such as hiking trails or a public street during a walk). Those with respiratory issues may want to wear a mask at these times just in case.
