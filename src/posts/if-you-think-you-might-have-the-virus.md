Depending on the state/commonwealth where you live, you may have trouble finding testing sites. Many localities have resources to direct you to testing in the area where you live. 

## Until you can get tested: 

* Avoid direct contact with others as much as possible; self-isolate at home as best you can.
* Monitor your temperature and symptoms
* Keep a paper chart or list of temperatures/symptoms as they appear
* Talk to your doctor or healthcare provider right away if you sense complications[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/testing.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/testing.html "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/testing.html")
