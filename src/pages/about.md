page_description: Why we did this, and where it's going.

---
This site was created by a group of people who couldn't figure out for the life of them what to do about the Coronavirus. Should we wear masks? Should we wash our groceries? Should we change clothes and disinfect our shoes when we get home from a store?

This site attempts to boil down _the best advice for your day-to-day life, as we understand it, right now._

## Who is doing this?

- __Jimmy Marks, Founder__ - Jimmy created this site to allow everyday people to quickly find out what they should be doing to help stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2, more commonly known as Coronavirus. By day, Jimmy works at a large tech consultancy focused on government software innovation. His previous projects include work for the EPA, several cabinet departments, and *Science* magazine.
